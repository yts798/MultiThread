# MultiThread
It is practice of process scheduling in a multi-processor environment.

It will be given a description of arriving processes including their arrival time, execution time in seconds, their id, and whether they are parallelisable or not. The first process always arrives at time 0, which is when the simulation begins.

implementation has been made for :
- Single processor scheduler
- Two processor scheduler
- N processor scheduler
